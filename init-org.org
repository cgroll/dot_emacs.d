files.

* Org task manager
This chapter determines all customized settings for using org-mode as
task planer. The settings are chosen in compliance with the Getting
things done methodology.

** Determine files for org agenda
First, we have to define which files to use when searching for tasks.
In this setting, all paths in the /~/org/ directory are on the path
list, and the file used as inbox bucket for captured notes is set to
/~/org/refile.org/. In order to synchronize these files privately
over multiple computers, the complete /~/org/ directory is only a
symbolic link to a folder stored in my dropbox.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/")))
  (setq org-default-notes-file "~/org/refile.org") 
#+END_SRC
** Determine files for notes captured by org-mode
In addition to all files regarding my daily tasks and appointments, I
also use org-mode to capture short notes about things I read.
Especially, I collect short information about software and coding
tricks that I stumble upon, and capture them in my computational
science directory /~/comp_science/, where plain text files with notes
regarding to all different topics are stored. These files again are
publicly available through at git repository stored at github. So far,
my notes files are:
- bash_notes.org :: contains notes on bash programming and all
                    important commands for the linux shell
- emacs_notes.org :: notes about emacs installation procedures, as
     well as installation procedures for all emacs extensions. Also,
     the structure of my emacs configuration is explained, together
     with descriptions on keeping my emacsen as git repository for
     simple syncronization between multiple computers.
- git_notes.org :: notes on subversion control with git and github
                   (which is also how I backup my emacs system
                   settings publicly).
- gtd_notes.org :: more elaborate description of the structure and
                   possibilities of the org task managing features.
                   gtd refers to "Getting things done", which is a
                   book regarding a detailled task management
                   procedure.
- e_lisp_notes.org :: notes on emacs lisp
- e_wanderlust_notes.org :: wanderlust email notes
- e_bbdb_notes.org :: using big brother database
- R_notes.org :: notes on statistical computing with R
- matlab_notes.org :: notes on using matlab
- julia_notes.org :: notes on using julia language
- literature_notes.org :: notes on digital literature management -
     comprises mendeleydesktop, JabRef, Citavi, etc.
- e_latex_notes.org :: notes on latex, with focus on latex in emacs

The respective public git-repo should be easily forked, so that everybody can
extend it with private notes.

*Remark: all these files shall be available publicly, so that none of them may
contain any sensitive private data!!*

** Todo states
I keep the following todo states:
- TODO :: every individual task generally gets a TODO mark
- NEXT :: if any higher-level task or project brings forth any
          subtask, then this is marked as NEXT. This way I shift tasks
          from my external projects to my agenda, without immediately
          integrating the complete major project. Furthermore,
          long-term targets are forced to be splitted into minor
          tasks, which are much better to focus on.
- DONE :: the classic label for finished tasks
- WAITING :: if a task is still prevailing, but can not be processed
             right now since it depends on someone else's action.
             Could be used to indicate some chronological temporal
             dependency on a different task. However, chronological
             ordering at best should be implemented directly.
- CANCELLED :: any task that suddenly is not required anymore
- SOMEDAYS :: captures any unconcrete long-term targets or just things
              that probably would be nice to having it doing
*** State definitions
Entering any todo state automatically will create a timestamp. While
the timestamp for TODO and NEXT will be made at its creation, all
other states are told to log the entry time with a "!" sign in the
state definition. Additionally, WAITING and CANCELLED will call for a
note, so that an explanation can be added. Also, most states will log
exiting times as well. Fast access for todo states are guaranteed with
shortcut letters for each state, which also have to be enabled:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-use-fast-todo-selection t)
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-todo-keywords
     (quote ((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d!/!)")
               (sequence "WAITING(w@/!)" "|" "CANCELLED(c@/!)" "SOMEDAY(s!/!)"))))
#+END_SRC
Here I determine custom face colors for my task state keywords.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
     (quote (("TODO" :foreground "red" :weight bold)
               ("NEXT" :foreground "blue" :weight bold)
               ("DONE" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold)
               ("WAITING" :foreground "orange" :weight bold)
               ("SOMEDAY" :foreground "magenta" :weight bold)
               ("CANCELLED" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold))))
#+END_SRC
When skipping through todo states for minor corrections with shift
key, log processing will be disabled. Otherwise we will get to many
timestamps.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change nil)
#+END_SRC

** Org-capture
The process of capturing tasks and notes is probably one of the most
important parts of the complete system. It is absolutely crucial to
the system that any information can be temporarily captured and shoved
away fast and without disturbing the current workflow. That means,
with very few shortcuts any information can be captured in a highly
adapted template tailored to the specific information requirements. At
a header level, information is classified as one of several main
topics:
- TODO task
- email response
- event, appointment, date
- note
At the second layer, more specific patterns are distinguished, like
storage location, prompts, tags and the like.
